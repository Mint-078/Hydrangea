Hydrangea

An Android application for interfacing with Hydrus through the client API service

No builds available yet as the app is currently very early in development, but you're free to build your own if you feel you can't wait. 

Current Features:
- Only supports image files
- Register with client api service
- Load thumbnails from the default file pool (It will currently try to load all of them, not tested on more than 100 or so files) 
- View full sized images
- Upload from file
- Upload from url

Planned Features (nonexhaustive):
- View tags
- Edit tags
- Make it look pretty

This is a project that I plan to run myself, but I am open to feature requests and comments.
